# Factory Intelligent Machine Monitor

A smart web dashboard for real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance of industrial machines. Tracks key metrics, predicts breakdowns, sends alerts, and enables remote shutdownâ€”helping small industries reduce downtime and repair costs.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, vibration, and RPM using ESP32 sensors
- Predictive maintenance with breakdown prediction
- Alert system for threshold breaches
- Remote shutdown control from the dashboard
- User authentication for secure access
- Analytics and anomaly detection for better decision-making

## Why This Project?
Unexpected machine breakdowns cause lost productivity and high repair costs. This project empowers managers to take proactive action, reduce downtime, and optimize production.

## Getting Started
1. Connect sensors to ESP32 and configure it to send data to the backend.
2. Set up the FastAPI backend to receive, log, and serve sensor data.
3. Open the dashboard in your browser and log in to monitor and control your machines.
